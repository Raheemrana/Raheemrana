# Hi, I'm Abdul Raheem Rana! 👋 (he/him)

I'm a problem solver in the world of tech 🚀, also known as a 'Software Engineer'. I'm deeply passionate about technology and love learning new things. With over 4 years of experience, I've dived into various tech areas - from making smart computer programs using Python to building websites with React, Node.js, Angular, FastAPI, and .NET. Recently, I became a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner, showing my interest in cloud computing. I'm all about finding solutions and making cool things with technology!

My career has been a balance between leveraging my technical expertise and embracing challenges. I've delved into DevOps, orchestrating CI/CD pipelines for microservice deployment on Fargate while contributing actively to a dynamic team. My commitment to excellence goes beyond meeting deadlines; it's about consistently delivering top-notch solutions and thriving in diverse environments.

As a professional, I love learning new things, especially about new technology. I enjoy making and trying out different coding projects, just like playing with toys. It's fun for me to build and then take apart these projects, like a kid discovering new games. This helps me learn more and keeps me excited about what I can create with code.

Outside of work, I value teamwork and achieving common goals. I'm enthusiastic about exploring diverse cultures and embracing diversity. Additionally, I enjoy playing sports, particularly cricket and ping pong, where I actively participate and excel as a player.

Driven by the belief that technology can revolutionize industries and improve lives, I am passionate about contributing my skills to pioneering initiatives that bring impactful change. My professional journey is a testament to my commitment to innovation, resilience, and an unyielding drive to craft solutions that transcend expectations.
